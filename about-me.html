            <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
            <p>
                Hey, I'm Ayoub. I was born in Al Hoceima, Morocco, grew up in Rabat, and now I live in Montreal.
                Telling my own story has never been easy, but if there's one thing that's been a constant in my life,
                it's soccer.
            </p>
            <p>
                It all started when I was a kid—playing in the streets, watching games with family, arguing about teams
                with friends, and even spending hours on soccer video games. What began as fun slowly became a real passion,
                one that's been with me through every stage of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I carry that love proudly. I support my hometown club, CRA (Chabab Rif Al Hoceima), while also
                following the ups and downs of OM and Arsenal. For me, soccer isn't just a sport—it's a way of connecting,
                learning, and feeling part of something bigger.
            </p>

            <h2>WHY THIS BLOG?</h2>
            <p>
                This blog is my way of sharing that passion with you. Whether it's breaking down the latest match,
                discussing transfer rumors, or reminiscing about classic moments, I want to create a space where football
                fans can connect, learn, and enjoy the beautiful game together.
